# Suicide Intent Detection using XGBoost

This project uses XGBoost to classify whether a user's statement indicates suicidal intent. To improve model performance, Random Search and Grid Search are used for hyperparameter tuning.

# Technologies Used

XGBoost: For efficient gradient boosting classification.

Random Search: To quickly explore hyperparameters.

Grid Search: For fine-tuning the best hyperparameters.

# Deploy project in streamlit
